## Notes 


- We started working on this lesson based on Jeff Goelenske's Workshop-outlining. The presentation was targeted towards WordPress professionals. This is great, but in order to reach a broader audience I'll recommend taking a step back. Start with "This is WordPress. Here's how you make a website" mentality
- At this point I'll also suggest to keep away from involving the code-side, therefore refraining from bringing in github to the program just yet
- Finally running this on a controlled environment would be a great idea. Like WordPress.com. However we need to teach people how to use WordPress in general, therefore a working WordPress website with Gutenberg –later to be just WordPress– installed will be a Material requisite for this lesson
- This workshop could easily be seen as part of a series like this
  - Learn to install WordPress
  - Build your first website with WordPress and Gutenberg
  - Introduction to plugins and themes
- Since we are trying to push gutenberg, taking a Frontend approach seems much more natural. I suggest running using only The Customizer and Gutenberg
